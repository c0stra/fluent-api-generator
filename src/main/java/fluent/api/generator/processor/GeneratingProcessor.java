/**
 * Template driven Java code generator, which generates code based on the annotated element.
 *
 * E.g. a method annotated with annotation @Generate(template) gets a model fully describing the method
 * with its return type, arguments and annotations, so they can be easily accessed and used in the JTwig
 * template language.
 *
 * That allows to generate various derived Java classes. Main motivation for this meets to generate fluent
 * builders, senders, verifiers, argument builders, etc.
